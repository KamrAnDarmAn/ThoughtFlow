I have very confusing bug i don't know from where it come:
bug detail:
this is my User schema i used prisma: (
  model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  username  String
  password  String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  posts     Post[]
)

this exact same schema is in database as well but when I fetch (users: async () => {
      const users = await prisma.user.findMany({});
      console.log(users);
      return usersHardCoded; // i just a random user for now
    }) this is resolver->Query code blow user fn

 Bug: but when i run this on apollo studio i get error there: ("message": "\nInvalid `prisma.user.findMany()` invocation:\n\n\nThe column `23dBlog.User.name` does not exist in the current database.",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 8,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": [
        "users"
      ],)
      this tell that name is not on schema/database while my schema and db desc is different 
      i don't know where is the error:
      i have notice this that:
      I use ( output   = "../generated/prisma") i prisma file 
      but when i import form ("../generated/prisma") this location it shows that it is not export module i thing it use common.js module
      is there any way to change ("../generated/prisma") this to module type?
